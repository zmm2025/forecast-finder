# forecast-finder
Simple program using Tkinter that can find the 5-day forecast for any city in the United States. Created for Awesome Inc Team Alpha Application Phase IV in one week.

## NOTE
This repository is simply a host of the code, but will not function if downloaded from GitHub due to an intentionally redactted API key. You'll need to use use the ZIP sent directly from the owner and follow the following instructions in order for the program to correctly function.
This program has also only been tested on WIndows 10 (due to resource and time limitations), but should work as expected on Mac and Linux.

## 1. Extract the ZIP folder
Extract the ZIP folder anywhere onto your computer. THe directory will be important for activation of the program.

## 2. Activate the virtual environment
On Win10, open command prompt via the hotkeys Win+X, C. Next, navigate to the extracted folder via the command `>cd path\to\ForecastFinder`. Next, activate the environment by running `>atmosphere\Scripts\activate`.

## 3. Install Python and packages
If Python is not already installed on your computer, run the command `>python` from the command terminal and install. Once installed, within the command terminal install the missing packages by running the command `>pip install geopy requests`.

## 4. Run the program
You are no able to run the program by executing the command `python forecastfinder.py`. Unofrtunately, due to time limitations and technical difficulties, you'll have to enable the virtual environment and execute this command each time you want to run the program after exiting your command prompt terminal.
